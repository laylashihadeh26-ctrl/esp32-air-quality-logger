This project presents a low-cost indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring system designed to evaluate ventilation in indoor spaces.
The system measures carbon dioxide (CO₂) and particulate matter (PM₁.₀ / PM₂.₅ / PM₁₀) and logs data to a microSD card for later analysis.
Built on an ESP32 microcontroller, the logger was used to monitor the American University of Beirut weight room over a two-week period in July–August 2025. Using CO₂ decay curves, the data were analyzed to estimate air change rates (ACR) and assess compliance with ASHRAE 62.1 ventilation standards.
